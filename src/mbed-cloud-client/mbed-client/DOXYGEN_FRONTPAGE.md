Mbed Client API
================

This is the Doxygen generated API documentation of Mbed Client. See the [Files](files.html) section to find the documentation about specific API. It should be used together with the [Mbed Client Guide](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-client-guide/en/latest/)
hosted in http://docs.mbed.com.

The Mbed Client high-level APIs allow mbed OS developers to create applications with LwM2M features as described in the [Lightweight Machine to Machine Technical Specification](http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/technical-information/release-program/current-releases/oma-lightweightm2m-v1-0):

These APIs make it possible to:

- Manage devices.
- Securely communicate with internet services over the industry standard TLS/DTLS.
- Fully control the endpoint and application logic.

The API is written in C++ to allow quick application development.
